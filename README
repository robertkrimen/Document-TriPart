NAME
    Document::TriPart - Read, write & edit a tri-part document (preamble,
    YAML::Tiny header, and body)

VERSION
    version 0.024

SYNOPSIS
        my $document;
        $document = Document::TriPart::->read( \<<_END_ ); # Or you can use ->read_string( ... )
        # vim: #
        ---
        hello: world
        ---
        This is the body
        _END_

        $document->preamble   "# vim: #\n"
        $document->header     { hello => world }
        $document->body       "This is the body\n"

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution is meant to take the headache out of reading, writing,
    and editing "interesting" documents. That is, documents with both
    content and meta-data (via YAML::Tiny)

    More documentation coming soon, check out the code and tests for usage
    and examples. This is pretty beta, so the interface might change.
